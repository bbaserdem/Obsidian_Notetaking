General guidelines to my Obsidian Vault found here

# Usage

* Use the "open today's daily note" to open and navigate the daily note.


## Daily Notes

The default template plugin is disabled, instead the *templater* plugin auto-inserts the more customize-able template whenever a daily note is created.

## Meeting Notes

This is the folder where I would keep my notes about my meetings.

## Git Usage

TODO: Do this part as well.

## Tags

Generally want to prefer tags in the yaml header of notes, but inline are also fine.

# Plugins

Guidelines on how to use plugins.

## Auto Note Mover

This plugin organizes files into different directories depending on wildcard matching the file name.
The auto note mover should only use tags to operate, making it's scope limited in this way.

# Future plans

* Zettelkasten
* Integrating with zotero for references
